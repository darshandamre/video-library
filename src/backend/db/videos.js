      "Liquid Paper | If Bruce Lee shuffled cards... | Cardistry by Virtuoso",
    creator: "thevirts",
    description: `While Cardistry was first birthed centuries ago from magicians who desired to add some flourishes to their card handling, it in itself contains no magic at all. In fact, while card magic involves the concealment of movement, Cardistry is the very opposite - revolving around the expression and aesthetics of movement and form. In other words, borders often end up obscuring what the Cardist wishes to showcase.
    
    Unfortunately, Cardistry was always regarded as a niche within the niche of magic, and Cardists had to make do with whatever decks they could get in their hands - that is, until Virtuoso came along.`

      "RISE | Crazy card moves with no CGI, strings, or magnets | Cardistry by Virtuoso",
    creator: "thevirts",
    description: `A note from The Virts about "RISE":
    
    If there's one thing we've learned from shuffling cards over the past 14 years, it's that you only get better at Cardistry as you repeatedly push yourself beyond your limits. The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.
    
    Today, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better we've gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating.`

    creator: "Cardistry Touch",
    description: `The Riffle Fan was first showcased in Dimitri's video “Silent Transition” in 2011. It has then been published in his dvd “Monument” (https://store.theory11.com/products/m...), but because the mechanics of the move evolved with the years, we've decide to release an upgraded tutorial.
    
    The Riffle Fan is definitely one of Dimitri's most treasured and favorite creation, and it's considered as modern classic: there is no doubt that adding it to your repertoire will help you grow as a cardist.
    
    Enjoy!

    creator: "Kevin Ho",
    description: `Backstory:
---
When I moved to California for college, I found myself using most of my free time to tinker with a deck of cards and come up with moves of my own. By the second semester, I had a decent handful of new material, plus a new HV20 camcorder that I got using the money I'd made from my book Smooth Operations. So one night, I grabbed my camera, a tripod, and a pack of Aladdins, and went down to the college gym to shoot a bunch of flourishes I'd been working on. I'd only shared this video with a small group of close friends before, but here it is now for your enjoyment.

P.S. This video is probably the first time that Backdrop ever appeared on recorded media - crazy to think that the move is 12 years old already!

Original video description:
---
What happens when you strip a flourish video down to its bare essentials - one man, one deck of cards, one camera angle? In the absence of video aesthetics emerges a form of beauty on its own - something PURE.`

    title: "ArrowDynamix Cardistry Deck - Official Trailer",
    creator: "Kevin Ho",
    description: `ArrowDynamix is a pet project that I first came up with in 2015. The idea of taking arrows and putting them on cards so that this ubiquitous symbol could both enhance and inform movements in Cardistry opened up a whole new world of possibilities, and over time the concept has evolved and culminated in the cards you see being used in this video.

Whether you're stacking them to create specific patterns and displays, using the arrows to act as creative hints in coming up with new moves, or if you're simply freestyling with the deck and allowing the arrows to generate random instances of apparent chaos, this deck is a tool that belongs in any Cardist's arsenal.

This trailer was filmed with the help of my friend Kyle Tran, who worked together with two Cardistry world champions - Lars Mayrand and Trevor Aguiar - along with ultra-talented Cardists Matthew Beaudouin and Azlan Valentine to capture all the lovely moves featured in this video. Do give them a follow on social media if you'd like to see more of their work!`
